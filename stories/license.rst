Nikola is released under the MIT license, which is a free software license.
Some components shipped along with Nikola, or required by it are released under
other licenses.

*If you are not familiar with free software licensing: In general, you should be
able to do pretty much anything you want, unless you modify Nikola. If you
modify it, and share it with someone else, that someone else should get all
your modifications under the same license you got it.*
