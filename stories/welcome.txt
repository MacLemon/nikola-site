Nikola is a Static Site and Blog Generator
------------------------------------------

In goes content, out comes a website, ready to deploy.


**Why Static Websites?**

Static websites are safer, use fewer resources, and avoid vendor and platform lock-in.
You can read more about this in the `Nikola Handbook. </handbook.html#why-static>`__

What Can Nikola Do?
-------------------

It has many features, but here are some of the nicer ones:

.. class:: nav-list

* `Blogs, with tags, feeds, archives, comments, etc. <some-sites-using-nikola.html>`_
* `Themable <theming.html>`_
* Fast builds, thanks to `doit <http://python-doit.sf.net>`_
* Flexible, extensible via plugins
* Small codebase (programmers can understand all of Nikola core in a day)
* `reStructuredText <quickstart.html>`_ [`Cheatsheet <http://ubuntuone.com/1M7C5fdbLkggF7ptoUvTq8>`_] or Markdown as input language (also Wiki, BBCode, Textile, and HTML)
* Easy `image galleries </galleries/demo/>`_ (just drop files in a folder!)
* Syntax highlighting for almost any programming language or markup
* Multilingual sites
* Doesn't reinvent wheels, leverages existing tools.
* Python 2 and 3 compatible.
