We’re pleased to announce the release of Nikola v6.4.0.

What is Nikola?
===============

Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.  It can
use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup
formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown — and can even turn
IPython Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image galleries,
and is multilingual.  Nikola is flexible, and page builds are extremely fast,
courtesy of doit (rebuilding only what has been changed).

Key Changes since v6.3.0
========================

* The ``code.css`` (and ``all*.css``) files have been revamped to support
  dark themes and Markdown properly.  Please remove those files from
  your output directory and run ``nikola build`` to get the fixes.
* ``nikola auto`` supports livereload v2.1.0.
* Added ``nikola new_page``, equivalent to ``nikola new_post -p``.
* Deploys to sub-directories (eg. ``http://example.com/blog/``) are
  now fully supported and bug-free.

Get it!
=======

Nikola is available for download at `GitHub`_ and `PyPI`_.

Debian Packages
===============

In the v6.3.0 announcement, it was promised that an ``install_bs3``
command would be added to the Debian packages.  The v6.3.0 packages
were released yesterday and they contain the promised patch.  Please
use it to install the theme if you need it.
