We just created a demo site for Coil CMS, the simple CMS-like solution that
lets users write content on a Nikola blog with ease.

You can now access:

.. class:: lead

* `the Nikola output site <https://coildemo-site.getnikola.com/>`_
* `the Coil CMS admin site (user: demo, password: demo) <https://coildemo-admin.getnikola.com/>`_

What is Coil CMS?
=================

Coil CMS is a basic CMS (with user management and a WYSIWYG HTML editor), which
uses Nikola to generate the pages, combining the best of both worlds: you (or
your editors) can easily create content, while the site is based on resilient
static pages. Users don’t even have to know what Nikola, Python or static
websites are. They just write their content. The only difference is that they
(or someone with the necessary permissions) need to click a *Rebuild* button to
make their changes show up on the website.

What is Nikola?
===============

Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.
It can use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup
formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown — and can even turn
Jupyter (IPython) Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image
galleries, and is multilingual. Nikola is flexible, and page builds
are extremely fast, courtesy of doit (which is rebuilding only what
has been changed).
