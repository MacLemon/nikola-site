Version 1.2 of Nikola, my static site generator and the software behind
`this very site <http://lateral.netmanagers.com.ar>`_, is out!

Why build static sites? Because they are light in resources, they are
future-proof, because it's easy, because they are safe, and because you
avoid lockin.

New Features:

* Image gallery (just drop pics on a folder)
* Built-in webserver for previews (``doit -a serve``)
* Helper commands to create new posts (``doit -a new_post``)
* Google Sitemap support
* A Handbook!
* Full demo site included
* Support for automatic deployment (``doit -a deploy``)
* Client-side redirections

And of course the *old* features:

* Write your posts in reStructured text
* Clean, customizable page design (via bootstrap)
* Comments via Disqus
* Support any analytics you want
* Build blogs with tags, feeds, feeds for your tags, indexes, and more
* Works like a simple CMS for things outside your blog
* Clean customizable templates using Mako
* Pure python, and not a lot of it (about 600 lines)
* Smart builds (doit only rebuilds changed pages)
* Easy to extend and improve
* Code displayed with syntax highlighting

Right now Nikola does literally everything I need, so if you try it and need
something else... it's a good time to ask!
