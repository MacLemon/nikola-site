I am happy to announce the release of `Nikola version 5.3. <http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar>`_ It includes some minor features
and a good amount of bugfixing. Upgrading to it should not cause you any trouble, as far
as I know.

Here's the changelog:

* Optionally use content distribution networks for jquery and twitter-bootstrap (USE_CDN option)
* Improve progressive rendering by moving javascript to the bottom of pages
* New Brazilian portuguese translation.
* New planetoid experimental extra_plugin

Bugfixes
--------

* Make really sure we import the right conf.py
* Make SLUG_TAG_PATH a config dep for most pages
* Removed meta title tag for better HTML validation
* Removed #999 background from footnote backlink.
* Made footnote references be superscripted.
* Centered figure's image and caption.
* Removed outset border from admonitions.
* Use default theme as last resource for messages/translations
* DATE_FORMAT option was being ignored
* Remove trailing "\" on windows gallery links (Issue #298)
* Inconsistent breadcrumbs in gallery pages (Issue #303)
* Use source files as bundle dependencies instead of outputs (Issue #294)

Enjoy!
