I am thrilled to announce the immediate release of Nikola version 6.0.0.

This is a major feature release. If you have an existing site, you will get a number of warnings about deprecated options. Don't worry, things most likely will still work, and you can take your time fixing them.

Some of the new features are described in a series of blog posts: `1 <http://ralsina.me/weblog/posts/new-in-nikola-v6-typography.html>`_ `2 <http://ralsina.me/weblog/posts/new-in-nikola-v6-part-ii-we-love-javascript.html>`_ `3 <http://ralsina.me/weblog/posts/new-in-nikola-v6-iii-comment-alternatives.html>`_ `4 <http://ralsina.me/weblog/posts/new-in-nikola-v6-part-iv-awesome-auto-mode.html>`_ `5 <http://ralsina.me/weblog/posts/new-in-nikola-v6-part-v-less-is-more.html>`_
