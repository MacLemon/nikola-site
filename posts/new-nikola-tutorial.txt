Tim van der Linden has written a **impressive** tutorial about how he used Nikola to 
create his new site `shisaa.jp <http://shisaa.jp/>`_

It documents the whole process from scratch, starting by downloading Nikola up to
building your own theme.

Even if you are already using `Nikola <http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar>`_ you may find some
new stuff there, so take a read (also, his theme is *so* pretty :-)
