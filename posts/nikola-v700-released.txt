On behalf of the Nikola team, I am pleased to announce the release of Nikola v7.0.0 (after 10 days of testing in RC1).

Nikola v7.0.0 is the first major release since 8 months.  As such, we had many things that could be changed.  There are some things that you might need to change on your site, especially if you have a custom theme. Here is a short and incomplete list of the most important changes:

Key Changes since v6.4.0
========================

* New dependencies: ``natsort`` (natural sorting in galleries) and ``dateutil`` (replaces ``pytz``)
* Many deprecated options were removed.
* SCHEDULE_FORCE_TODAY, EXTRA_PLUGINS and ENABLED_EXTRAS are now removed and have no effect.

* Two options were changed:

    - HIDE_SOURCELINK → SHOW_SOURCELINK (inverted)
    - HIDE_UNTRANSLATED_POSTS → SHOW_UNTRANSLATED_POSTS (inverted)

* READ_MORE_LINK is split into INDEX_READ_MORE_LINK and RSS_READ_MORE_LINK.
  Moreover, new tags, like ``(remaining_)reading_time`` and ``(remaining_)paragraph_count``, were added.
* Added options: FORCE_ISO8601, LOGO_URL, SHOW_BLOG_TITLE (logo support), GENERATE_RSS, ROBOTS_EXCLUSIONS, CONTENT_FOOTER_FORMATS, RSS_PLAIN, UNSLUGIFY_TITLES (for meta extraction from filenames).
* Certain settings are now translatable.  As of now, the settings are:

    BLOG_AUTHOR, BLOG_TITLE, BLOG_DESCRIPTION, LICENSE, CONTENT_FOOTER,
    SOCIAL_BUTTONS_CODE, SEARCH_FORM, BODY_END, EXTRA_HEAD_DATA,
    NAVIGATION_LINKS, READ_MORE_LINK.

* There are many changes to themes.  The ``base`` theme now offers a stylish look and is usable on sites, through a new stylesheet.  The HTML code is now more semantic and sectioned, making it easier to style sites. Some templates are also renamed or removed.
* The basic Jinja themes (base-jinja, bootstrap-jinja, bootstrap3-jinja) are now shipped with Nikola.  Please remove any leftover copies from your themes/ folders.
* You now can (and should!) specify a timezone offset in post dates, using a ``UTC±00:00`` syntax. (warning: ``UTC-03:00`` means *3 hours east of UTC* and not *west*, as is done in some Unix tools!)  You can also use ISO 8601 dates (and if you want to do that, you can set ``FORCE_ISO8601=True`` to get those in new_post and new_page)
* You now can use the reST metadata format in .meta files, allowing for greater flexibility.

Get it!
