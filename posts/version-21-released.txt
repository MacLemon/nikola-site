.. admonition:: Update

   This version was missing 2 files in the site theme, please get 2.1.1 instead. 


The new release is available at `GoogleCode <http://code.google.com/p/nikola-generator/downloads/list>`_.
It contains a number of bugfixes, and some new features:

* The input format for your site is now modular. This version includes support for
  `Markdown <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`_

* The theme support is much cleaner. It even comes with two themes! To learn
  more, there is a `theming guide <http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar/theming.html>`_

* All links in pages generated by Nikola are relative, which means you can deploy
  to anywhere in your server and all links will work.

* Translation support has been greatly improved, and translations are now welcome!

* There is now better support to add your own files into the output folder (just put them
  in "files" and they will be copied as needed).
