I wrote a new theming tutorial for `Nikola (a static website generator!) <http://getnikola.com>`__ which
focuses in porting the awesome `Lanyon <http://lanyon.getpoole.com/>`__ theme from Jekyll.

You can `see more information about the theme, <https://themes.getnikola.com/#lanyon>`__ `read the tutorial <https://getnikola.com/creating-a-theme.html>`__ or see `how the theme looks in action. <https://themes.getnikola.com/v7/lanyon/index.html>`__

Hopefully this will encourage users to create and share more themes!
