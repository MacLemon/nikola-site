A simple yet powerful and flexible static website and blog generator, based on doit,
mako, docutils and bootstrap.

I built this to power this very site you are reading, but decided it may be useful
to others. The main goals of Nikola are:

* Small codebase: because I don't want to maintain a big thing for my blog
* Fast page generation: Adding a post should not take more that 5 seconds to build.
* Static output: Deployment using rsync is smooth.
* Flexible page generation: you can decide where everything goes in the final site.
* Powerful templates: Uses `Mako <http://www.makotemplates.org/>`_
* Clean markup for posts: Uses `Docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>`_
* Don't do stupid builds: Uses `doit <http://python-doit.sourceforge.net/>`_
* Clean HTML output by default: Uses `bootstrap <http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>`_
* Comments out of the box: Uses `Disqus <http://disqus.com/>`_
* Tags, with their own RSS feeds
* Easy way to do a blog
* Static pages outside the blog
* Multilingual blog support (my own blog is english + spanish)

I think this initial version achieves all of those goals, but of course, it can be improved. Feedback is very welcome!
