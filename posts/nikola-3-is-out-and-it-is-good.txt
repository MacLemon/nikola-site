I just released version 3 of my static site generator, `Nikola <http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar>`_

It's a *major* release, there is hardly any code from the previous version that was not
moved, prodded, broken or fixed!

The main features of Nikola:

* Blogs, with tags, feeds, archives, comments, etc.
* Themable
* Fast builds, thanks to doit
* Flexible
* Small codebase (programmers can understand all of Nikola in a few hours)
* reStructuredText and Markdown as input languages
* Easy image galleries (just drop files in a folder!)
* Syntax highlighting for almost any programming language or markup
* Multilingual sites
* Doesn't reinvent wheels, leverages existing tools.

Changes for this release (not exhaustive!):

* New optional template argument for "nikola init"
* New "install_theme" task
* Optional address option for the "serve" task
* Better looking codeblocks
* Russian translation
* Use markdown/reSt compiler based on post extension
* Don't fail when there are no posts/stories/galleries/tags
* Use configuration options as dependencies
* Use more relative links for easier site rellocation
* Syntax highlight for markdown
* Better multicore builds (make the -n 2 or -n 4 options work)
* Configurable output folder
* Don't fail on posts with periods in the name
* Different page names for different languages
* Recognize (some) Mako template dependencies
* Is now a more "normal" python package.
