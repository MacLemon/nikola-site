I added a very minor feature to the site. Up here ^ you should be able to see a link that says "reSt".
If you click on it, it will show you the "source code" for the page.

I did this for a few reasons: 

1) Because a comment seemed to suggest it ;-) 
2) Because it seems like a nice thing to do. Since I so like reSt, I would like others to use it, too. And showing how easy it is
   to write using it, is cool.
3) It's the "free software-y" thing to do. I am providing you the preferred way to modify my posts.
4) It was ridiculously easy to add.

Also, if you see something missing, or something you would like to have on the site, please comment, I will try to add it.
