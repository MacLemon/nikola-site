On behalf of the Nikola team, I am pleased to announce the immediate
availability of Nikola v7.6.0. It fixes some bugs and adds new
features.

What is Nikola?
===============

Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.
It can use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup
formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown — and can even turn
Jupyter (IPython) Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image
galleries, and is multilingual. Nikola is flexible, and page builds
are extremely fast, courtesy of doit (which is rebuilding only what
has been changed).

Key Changes since v7.5.1
========================

* ``nikola auto`` fixed for Python 3 and while rebuilding
* ``nikola auto`` now uses watchdog and supports **Windows**
* Support for Jupyter Notebooks: you can now use non-Python ``.ipynb``
  files with Nikola (``ipynb@KERNEL`` to pick a kernel)
* Added ``nikola new_post -F`` to list available compilers
* Better print CSS
* Per-post filters via metadata

Downloads
