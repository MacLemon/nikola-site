I am thrilled to announce that you can now `download Nikola 5.2. <http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar>`_

What's new in this version? *A LOT*. Don't let the minor version tick fool you, this version
is *packed* with goodness. Let's start with features:

You can easily embed more content:

* New vimeo directive for restructured text.
* Custom "gist" directive providing reStructured text support for GitHub gists.

You can write your content in almost any markup:

* Textile markup support.
* Creole Wiki markup support.
* txt2tags markup support.
* bbcode markup support.
* And of course, it still supports reStructured text, Markdown and HTML.

More languages:

* New Catal√° translation
* New polish translation.
* New Simplified Chinese translation.
* Use multilingual Disqus (although it doesn't seem to work)

You can import your data:

* New Blogger/Blogspot importer
* Much improved Wordpress importer
* Extract metadata from filename by using regexp (helpful for importing from octopress or other systems).

You can do fancier and more configurable sites:

* One-page, dynamic-loading, client-rendered site plugin (task_mustache)
* Recursive post/story folders
* New COMMENTS_IN_GALLERIES and COMMENTS_IN_STORIES options.
* Local search based on Tipue (extra_plugins/task_localsearch)
* Added comments to image galleries
* New option RSS_TEASERS
* New STORY_INDEX option to generate index.html in story folders.
* Add multi size favicon support.

You can use Python 2.6 or higher ... **including Python 3.**
The only missing bit for full Python 3 support is Google sitemap generation.

And of course, a lot of bugs got smashed:

* Added sane defaults for most options, so you can have a lean config file.
* Made layout of the site theme responsive, with collapsing navbar.
* Use timeline instead of parsing post_pages in generic_page_renderer and task_render_pages.
* Updated disqus integration code, added identifiers so it works on any URL.
* Make sure folder links end in "/" in the gallery code.
* Removed copy of PyRSS2Gen, made it a dependency.
* Detect "namespace" dependencies for Mako templates.
* Use consistent encodings in RSS feeds.
* Refactored disqus code into separate helpers
* Use the correct extension (or raise an error) on new_post
* Fix titles that include quotes
* Updated to current CSS from docutils (was using version from 2005)
* Avoid needless regeneration of gallery indexes.
* Always ensure the folder for the new post exists.
* Get title from filename if not available in metadata.
* Don't copy sources if they end in ".html"
* Don't link to unexisting translations.
* Sort tags case insensitive.

Enjoy!
