.. description: Version 7.3.0 of Nikola is out!
.. type: text
.. author: Roberto Alsina

On behalf of the Nikola team, I am pleased to announce the immediate
availability of Nikola v7.3.0.  It features many bugfixes, and also
some new useful features.

What is Nikola?
===============

Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.  It can
use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup
formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown — and can even turn
IPython Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image galleries,
and is multilingual.  Nikola is flexible, and page builds are
extremely fast, courtesy of doit (which is rebuilding only what has
been changed).

Changes
=======

Features
--------

* Added ``-a``, ``--author`` option to set post author field
* Added option INDEXES_PRETTY_PAGE_URL to make URLs for indexes
  pages more pretty. (Issue #1548)
* Added ``-i``, ``--import`` argument to ``new_post`` for importing
  existing post contents (Issue #1385)
* Added warning about ``password`` in posts being insecure
  (Issue #1547)
* INDEXES_TITLE and INDEXES_PAGES are translatable (Issue #1544)
* Added new option ARCHIVES_ARE_INDEXES which allows archive pages
  which list posts to be rendered with the post contents.
  (Issue #1537)
* Added new option INDEXES_STATIC which allows to define the
  page ordering for indexes (Issue #1537). Also, if tag pages are
  created as indexes, they will behave more close to the
  default indexes.
* Use ``table`` line-numbering style with reST code, making
  copy-pasting code possible (Issue #1285)
* Tag and category pages are now more separated. The prefix for
  category pages can be changed and the folder can be modified
  independently of the tags' folder. (Issue #1535)
* Writing the tag cloud data file can now be disabled. Will be
  disabled by default in the future. (Issue #1535)
* The ``utils.config_changed`` function now takes an optional extra
  argument, ``identifier``, used to identify the source of a specific
  dependency save.  As such, ALL your files will be rebuilt after
  upgrading. (Issue #1526 via #1521)
* New option GALLERY_FOLDERS replacing GALLERY_PATH (Issue #1511)
* New PANDOC_OPTIONS option (Issue #1492)
* New tab-width option in code-block directive (Issue #1514)
* New option TAG_PAGES_DESCRIPTIONS for optionally making individual
  tag pages more unique and interesting (Issue #1486)
* New option LISTINGS_FOLDERS (which replaces LISTINGS_FOLDER) which
  allows to separate input and output folder names for listings, and
  allows to have more than one listings folder (Issue #1499)
* ReST listing directive now honors alternative listings folder names
  (Issue #1499)
* New command line option --conf= to specify the configuration file
  (default is conf.py) (Issue #1501)
* Added Arabic translation (by darkwise)
* Added Danish translation (by mikkelkristiansen)
* Added Indonesian translation (by Willy Sudiarto Raharjo)
* Added Korean translation (by Dong Geun)
* Added Serbian translation (by Ivan Radeljic)
* Added Swedish translation (by Johan Sommerfeld)
* New advanced option RSS_LINKS_APPEND_QUERY for tracking traffic
  from RSS subscribers
* Add ``robots`` meta tag with value ``noindex`` for drafts
  (Issue #1489)
* New option TAGLIST_MINIMUM_POSTS allows hiding unpopular tags from
  the tag index page (Issue #1484)
* New options CREATE_FULL_ARCHIVES and CREATE_DAILY_ARCHIVE which
  allow to create non-hierarchical archives and archives for days,
  respectively (Issue #1494)
* New plugin for creating image thumbnails, and a corresponding reST
  plugin (Issue #1527)
