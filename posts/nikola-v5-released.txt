A new version of Nikola is out! You can get it at `the usual place. <http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar>`_

This version is not completely backwards compatible, thus the new major version number, but
switching to it should be easy-ish. If you are using version 4.0.3:

1) Remove your dodo.py
2) Use ``nikola build`` instead of ``doit`` from now on
3) use ``nikola serve`` instead of ``doit serve``, ``nikola new_post`` instead of ``doit new_post``, and so on.
   Some other ``doit task`` are also converted into ``nikola command`` you can get
   the list using ``nikola help``

The integration of doit into Nikola is not done in a very nice way, that's still
ongoing work, but it should be Good Enough To Work (TM).

Hope you enjoy this release!
