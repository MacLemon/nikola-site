If you want a very minimalistic theme for a Nikola-based site, I just did a quick and dirty
port of Scott Wallick's `blog.txt theme <http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/blogtxt>`_


If there is anything nice here, he did it. If there is something wrong
or broken, I did it instead.

I did it basically to see if it was possible to port wordpress themes to Nikola.
And it is, but it involves reading php files and loosely reinterpreting them
into Mako templates.

While the port is far from perfect, it's a reasonable starting point for someone who
is really interested in it.

Here is how it looks:

   :target: http://lateral.netmanagers.com.ar/weblog/posts/a-port-of-blogtxt-to-nikola.html
   :width: 50%

And `here is the download <http://lateral.netmanagers.com.ar/static/nikola-blogtxt-theme.zip>`_. To use it, just unzip it in your
themes folder, set THEME to "blogtxt" in your dodo.py file, and rebuild the site.

At least the CSS files are easily adapted.

This theme is under a LGPL license (see included license.txt), enjoy!
