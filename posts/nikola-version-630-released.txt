.. title: Nikola version 6.3.0 released
.. slug: nikola-version-630-released
.. author: Chris Warrick

Version 6.3.0 of Nikola is out.  This is a large improvement, with many
features and bugfixes (it is also over a month late, sorry!)

Compatibility Warnings
======================

If you have your own locale files, you may want to check them.  There were some
changes lately.

If you use any themes from the Themes Index, make sure to update them — and
make sure to upgrade the whole inheritance tree.  For example, the
``base-jinja`` theme has a new file (``tagindex.tmpl``).

Debian and Bootstrap 3
======================

During this release cycle, we discovered that the Debian (and Ubuntu) packages
remove our copy of Bootstrap 3 and don’t provide any replacement.  For those
users, a ``install_bs3`` command is provided.  It is available only for people
who installed from those packages (after all, nobody else should need it).
Patch: `install_bs3 for Debian <https://gist.github.com/8583698>`_.

Downloads at `GitHub
<https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/releases/tag/v6.3.0>`_ and
`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Nikola>`_, as usual.
